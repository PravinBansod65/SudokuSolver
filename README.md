No addition is involved; however there are three conditions that rely on each other and must be followed. Each number 1-9 can appear only once in each column, once in each row, and once in each small 3 x 3 grid. Mathematically, Sudoku puzzles are a derivation of Latin Squares.

How do you play Sudoku?

The Sudoku puzzle consists of a series of grids. The grids include one large 9 x 9 grid that houses, nine 3 x 3 smaller grids. The purpose of the game is to place a number from 1-9 in each of the grid cells. You don't have to worry about finding the sum of the numbers of the rows, columns, like in Magic Squares.

CHECK MOVES

Check if the rows and columns contain values 1-9, without repetition.
If any row or column violates this condition, the Sudoku board is invalid.
Check to see if each of the 9 sub-squares contains values 1-9, without repetition. If they do, the Sudoku board is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
Whenver you take a wrong turn then it will shows red colour over the screen. And you will surely correct it.
